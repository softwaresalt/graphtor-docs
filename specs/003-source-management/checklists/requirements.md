# Specification Quality Checklist: Source Registry & Acquisition

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Spec covers all 5 FG-002 sub-features: sources.yaml registry usage, Git acquisition, local scanning, glob filtering, and source validation
- Dependency on FG-001 (Rust Foundation) clearly documented in Assumptions and Out of Scope
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers — all ambiguities resolved with reasonable defaults documented in Assumptions
- Implementation technology references (serde_yaml, git2, globset) intentionally kept out of spec; they belong in the plan phase
