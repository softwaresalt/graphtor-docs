## backlogit query

Execute a read-only SQL query against the index

items, dependencies, logs, and indexed stash data.

```text
backlogit query "<sql>" [flags]
```

### Examples

```text
  backlogit query "SELECT id, title, status FROM items ORDER BY updated_at DESC LIMIT 20"
  backlogit query "SELECT stash_id, kind, state FROM stash_entries ORDER BY updated_at DESC"
```

### Options

```text
  -h, --help   help for query
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```text
      --cwd string         workspace directory (default ".")
      --log-level string   log level: debug, info, warn, error (overrides BACKLOGIT_LOG_LEVEL)
```
