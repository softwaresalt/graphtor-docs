## backlogit telemetry harvest

Parse Copilot CLI logs and write telemetry-sessions.jsonl

### Synopsis

Parse Copilot CLI logs and write telemetry-sessions.jsonl

Each harvest run performs two writes:

1. Primary output: appends new session_summary and tool_usage JSONL records to
   .backlogit/telemetry-sessions.jsonl. Incremental by default, only sessions
   seen since the last checkpoint are appended. Use --force to rewrite from scratch.

2. SQLite rehydration (side effect): after writing the JSONL, harvest calls
   EnsureTelemetrySchema and RehydrateTelemetry to rebuild the telemetry_sessions
   and telemetry_tool_usage tables in .backlogit/backlogit.db. The tables are
   cleared and repopulated from the full JSONL on every run.

The SQLite tables are ephemeral cache. They can be deleted and will be recreated
on the next telemetry harvest or backlogit sync.

Use backlogit telemetry report or backlogit telemetry top to query the harvested
data after running harvest.

### Checkpoint

A harvest checkpoint is saved to .backlogit/.telemetry-checkpoint.json after each
successful run. The checkpoint records file offsets for each parsed log file so
subsequent runs read only new log entries. Delete the checkpoint or use --force to
reparse all logs from the beginning.

```text
backlogit telemetry harvest [flags]
```

### Options

```text
      --force          Re-process all logs from the beginning, ignoring the saved checkpoint
  -h, --help           help for harvest
      --since string   Exclude events before this RFC3339 timestamp (e.g. 2026-04-01T00:00:00Z)
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```text
      --cwd string         workspace directory (default ".")
      --log-level string   log level: debug, info, warn, error (overrides BACKLOGIT_LOG_LEVEL)
```
