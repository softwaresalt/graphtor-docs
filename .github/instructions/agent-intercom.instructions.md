# Agent-Intercom Instructions

Use these rules when the workspace enabled the `agent-intercom` capability pack. This pack is not a
single bolt-on step. It weaves remote operator visibility and approval routing through the harness
workflow.

## Required Tool Surface

The workspace should expose an intercom-style tool surface for these behaviors:

* **heartbeat / ping** — confirm liveness and reset stall detection
* **broadcast** — send non-blocking progress updates to the operator channel
* **auto-check / approval** — determine whether a destructive action can proceed without review and, when needed, request operator clearance
* **transmit** — ask the operator for clarification or continuation input
* **standby** — wait for the operator to resume or steer the agent

Use the workspace's registered intercom tool names or aliases. Do not invent alternate approval flows.

## Startup Protocol

At the start of a multi-step task or long-running session:

1. Call heartbeat / ping with a concise status message.
2. If the intercom path is reachable, broadcast the task start and major phase.
3. If the intercom path is unreachable, warn that remote visibility is degraded before continuing.

## Progress Protocol

Broadcast at meaningful transitions, not every trivial thought:

* planning started / plan ready / plan blocked
* build loop started / task claimed / task completed / task blocked
* review started / review complete / findings require intervention
* runtime verification started / passed / follow-up needed / failed
* operational closure ready / ready with conditions / blocked

Every progress broadcast at these meaningful transitions must carry the output
timestamp defined by `.github/instructions/output-timestamps.instructions.md`.
Use that universal instruction as the single source of truth for the ISO-8601 UTC
plus delta format; do not duplicate or diverge from the format here.

For non-destructive file writes, prefer concise status messages such as `[FILE] created:` or `[FILE] modified:` with the affected path when the intercom workflow supports it.

## Dark Factory Visibility Protocol

When `DARK_MODE_ACTIVE` is present under P-017, broadcasts must be self-contained
enough for a remote operator to understand scope, authority, gate state, and
risk without reading the full chat transcript.

Emit these dark-mode events or their workspace-equivalent log records:

| Event | Required broadcast content |
|---|---|
| `DARK_MODE_START` | resolved scope, merge-approval authority, admin-fallback authority, stop conditions, visibility mode |
| `DARK_MODE_SCOPE` | concrete stash IDs, feature/task IDs, shipment IDs, and any explicitly excluded items |
| `BRAINSTORM_HANDOFF_READY` | brainstorm/requirements artifact path, unresolved questions, and handoff target |
| `LOCAL_REVIEW_READY` | reviewed HEAD, readiness outcome, P0/P1 counts, follow-ups or residual-risk notes, shadow-review posture |
| `DARK_MODE_MERGE_AUTHORIZED` | PR number, reviewed HEAD, checks state, merge strategy, approval source, and scope match |
| `ADMIN_FALLBACK_ATTEMPTED` | after the fallback command/API returns: PR number, block classification, fallback authority, command/API used, and actual result |
| `DARK_MODE_HALTED` | halt reason, violated policy or stop condition, affected scope item, and required operator action |
| `DARK_MODE_COMPLETE` | shipped/closed shipments, decisions, gate outcomes, reviewed HEADs, merge/fallback outcome, closure status, and follow-up items |

If intercom becomes unavailable during dark mode, emit a degraded-visibility
warning in the local session/PR summary and continue only with safe,
non-destructive work. Approval-dependent destructive actions, scope expansion,
admin fallback, failed local readiness, secrets exposure risk, and ambiguous
branch-protection state must halt rather than proceed silently.

## Combined Rule for backlogit-enabled staging

When the `agent-intercom` and `backlogit` capability packs are both enabled and
an agent is presenting stash, queue, or backlog choices to the operator:

1. Make the broadcast self-contained enough for remote selection.
2. Include each candidate item's ID, priority, kind or type, and a one-line
   summary.
3. Include the recommended ordering or shortlist rationale and clearly state
   that operator selection or confirmation is awaited.
4. Do not assume the operator can see the full chat transcript to recover the
   missing context.

## Approval Protocol

For destructive actions:

1. Run the intercom auto-check step first.
2. If the action is not auto-approved, request operator clearance through the intercom approval workflow.
3. Execute only after an explicit approval result.
4. If intercom is unavailable, do not silently bypass required approval.

This applies to destructive terminal commands and destructive file operations.

## Clarification and Wait Protocol

When the agent is blocked on operator intent, missing approval, or a handoff decision:

* use the intercom transmit flow for clarifying questions or continuation prompts
* use the standby flow when intentionally waiting for the operator to resume or steer the session
* report back to the main workflow when the wait resolved, timed out, or was rejected

## Degraded-Mode Rule

If the intercom service becomes unavailable mid-task:

* warn that operator visibility is degraded
* continue only with safe, non-destructive work that does not depend on remote approval
* treat approval-dependent destructive actions as blocked until intercom is restored or the operator provides another path
