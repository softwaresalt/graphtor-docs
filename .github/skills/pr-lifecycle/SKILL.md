# PR Lifecycle Skill

Manage the branch-to-merged workflow for a feature or chore branch. This
skill creates or updates the pull request, responds to review feedback,
keeps CI healthy, and stops at the user merge gate unless the user
explicitly approves the merge.

## Purpose

Use this skill when implementation work is ready to move through pull
request execution. It centralizes the PR control loop so higher-level
agents can treat review, CI follow-up, and merge approval as one bounded
workflow.

## Agent-Intercom Communication

When the `agent-intercom` capability pack is installed, call `ping` at
session start. If reachable, broadcast at every step. If unreachable,
warn the operator that visibility is degraded and continue locally.

## Inputs

* `${input:branch}`: (Required) Branch name to ship.
* `${input:title}`: (Optional) PR title override. When omitted, derive
  the title from the branch name or prepared PR description.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Prepare the branch

1. Confirm the branch exists locally and is ready to push.
2. Gather or generate the PR title and body before calling GitHub
   tooling.
3. Push the branch if it is not already available on the remote.

### Step 2: Create or update the pull request

1. Use the GitHub CLI (`gh pr create` or `gh pr edit`) to create or
   refresh the pull request.
2. Capture the PR URL, branch, and base branch as the active context.
3. Reuse an existing PR when the branch already has one instead of
   creating duplicates.

### Step 2b: Request automated review

When the repository is hosted on GitHub, request Copilot Review
immediately after PR creation or after pushing new commits:

1. Request review per `.github/instructions/github-pr-automation.instructions.md` §1.1.
2. Poll for review completion using the back-off cadence in §1.2.
3. Do not block on review — proceed to CI monitoring in parallel when
   possible, but complete the review poll before entering the fix cycle.

### Step 3: Handle review feedback

1. Monitor PR review comments, especially automated review comments.
2. For GitHub-hosted repositories, follow the complete Copilot Review
   workflow in `.github/instructions/github-pr-automation.instructions.md` Part 1:
   categorize comments (§1.3), apply fixes (§1.4), reply to threads
   (§1.5), and resolve bot-authored threads via GraphQL (§1.6).
3. For non-GitHub repositories, apply bounded fixes directly when they
   are clearly actionable.
4. Re-run the relevant validation after each fix cycle.
5. Keep the PR description and review context aligned with the latest
   branch state.

### Step 4: Handle CI failures

1. If CI fails, invoke the `fix-ci` skill with the active PR or branch
   context.
2. For GitHub-hosted repositories, ensure the fix-ci skill follows the
   CI polling protocol in `.github/instructions/github-pr-automation.instructions.md` Part 2
   for status monitoring, failure extraction, and fix-push-poll loops.
3. Let `fix-ci` own the remediation loop for failing checks and
   unresolved review comments.
4. Return to PR monitoring once CI and review status are clean again.

### Step 4b: Re-request review after fixes

When fixes were pushed (from either review or CI remediation):

1. Re-request Copilot Review per `.github/instructions/github-pr-automation.instructions.md`
   §1.7.
2. Poll for the new review using the same back-off cadence.
3. Resolve any remaining bot-authored threads per §1.6.
4. Repeat until the review is clean or the review-fix cycle limit is
   reached.

### Step 5: Merge approval gate

#### Step 5a: Pre-Merge Review Readiness Verification (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Before presenting the PR as merge-ready, run the defense-in-depth
Copilot review readiness verification defined in
`.github/instructions/github-pr-automation.instructions.md` §1.9:

1. Execute the §1.9 readiness query (with full pagination of review
   threads).
2. Evaluate all three gate checks in order:
   - **Check 1**: No pending Copilot review request. If pending, wait
     per §1.2 back-off cadence.
   - **Check 2**: Latest Copilot review covers the current `headRefOid`.
     If stale, wait for a fresh review.
   - **Check 3**: Zero unresolved Copilot review threads. If any remain,
     halt and report.
3. If any check fails and the wait budget is exhausted, **halt**. Do not
   present the PR as merge-ready. Report the blocking condition to the
   operator.
4. If Check 3 fails with unresolved threads and the review-fix cycle
   budget (§1.8) has remaining capacity, loop back to Step 3 to address
   the unresolved comments. If the budget is exhausted, halt.
5. Surface human review threads, `reviewDecision`, and any
   `CHANGES_REQUESTED` reviews in the merge-readiness summary — these
   may independently block merge at the GitHub level.

#### Step 5b: Present merge readiness

1. When the §1.9 gate passes and checks are green, present the status
   to the user.
2. Wait for explicit user approval before any merge action.
3. **Never auto-merge** and never treat silence as approval.
4. If the user does not approve merge, leave the PR open and report
   the ready state.
5. **Operator approval gate (P-014)**: After the §1.9 gate passes, wait for an
   explicit operator approval signal. Green CI is not approval. A passing §1.9
   gate is not approval. Record P-014 (via P-005 telemetry) if merge is executed
   without an explicit approval signal.
6. **Branch retention (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**: Remain on the current feature
   or chore branch while awaiting merge approval. Do NOT checkout
   `main` or any other branch. The calling agent (Ship)
   depends on the branch context being preserved for post-merge work.

#### Step 5c: Last-Mile §1.9 Re-check Before Merge Execution

After receiving operator approval and before executing the merge:

1. Check whether any new commits have been pushed to the branch since the §1.9
   gate ran. If yes, re-run §1.9 in full — the prior gate result is stale.
2. Check whether any new Copilot review threads have been opened since the §1.9
   gate ran (query `reviewThreads` filtered to `isResolved == false` and
   `author.login == "copilot-pull-request-reviewer"`). If any new unresolved
   threads exist, halt and report — do not proceed to merge.
3. If the branch HEAD and review state are unchanged from the §1.9 gate run,
   log `P-014 LAST-MILE CHECK PASSED: branch unchanged, no new unresolved threads`.
4. Execute the merge only after this check passes.

This last-mile check closes the race window between approval receipt and merge
execution. It is a lightweight incremental query (not a full §1.9 re-run) when the
branch has not changed.

### Step 6: Post-merge cleanup

After a user-approved merge:

1. Report the merge result and resulting default-branch state.
2. **Do NOT checkout `main` and start working on it.**
   Post-merge closure work belongs on a dedicated `post-merge/` branch
   created by the Ship agent. This skill's responsibility ends at
   reporting the merge result.
3. Delete the feature branch only when that cleanup is requested or
   already part of the chosen PR flow.
4. Summarize any follow-up items, release notes, or residual risks
   that remain after merge.

## Completion Criteria

The skill is complete only when one of these outcomes is explicit:

* the PR is open and ready, waiting on user merge approval
* the PR feedback and CI loop is blocked with a clear reason
* the PR was merged after explicit user approval

## Stop Conditions

| Counter | Limit | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Fix-CI delegation cycles | 5 | Halt, leave PR for manual intervention |
| Review-fix cycles | 3 | Accept remaining as backlog follow-ups |

## Model Routing

This skill operates at **Tier 2 (Standard)** — PR creation and follow-up is routine coordination.
