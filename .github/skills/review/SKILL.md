# Code Review

Reviews code changes using dynamically selected reviewer personas. Spawns persona subagents that return structured findings, then merges and deduplicates into a unified report.

## Agent-Intercom Communication (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Call `ping` at session start. If agent-intercom is reachable, broadcast at every step. If unreachable, warn the user that operator visibility is degraded.

When the `strict-safety` capability pack is installed, also follow
`.github/instructions/strict-safety.instructions.md`: for high-risk diffs, call
out the `ProposedAction`, `ActionRisk`, approval, and rollback gaps that should
be visible before merge or deployment.

| Event | Level | Message prefix |
|---|---|---|
| Review start | info | `[REVIEW] Starting {mode} review of {scope}` |
| Diff analyzed | info | `[REVIEW] Analyzed diff: {file_count} files, {line_count} lines changed` |
| Persona routing | info | `[REVIEW] Routing: {always_on_count} always-on + {conditional_count} conditional personas` |
| Persona spawned | info | `[SPAWN] {persona_name} for code review` |
| Persona returned | info | `[RETURN] {persona_name}: {finding_count} findings` |
| Merge complete | info | `[REVIEW] Merged: {total} findings ({p0} P0, {p1} P1, {p2} P2, {p3} P3)` |
| Autofix applied | info | `[REVIEW] Applied safe_auto fix: {finding_summary}` |
| Review written | success | `[REVIEW] Review artifact: {file_path}` |
| Waiting for input | warning | `[WAIT] Blocked on user decision` |
| Review complete | success | `[REVIEW] Complete: {summary}` |

## Subagent Depth Constraint

This skill spawns reviewer subagents. Those subagents are leaf executors and MUST NOT spawn their own subagents. Maximum depth: review skill → persona subagent (1 hop).

## Mode Detection

Check arguments for `mode:autofix` or `mode:report-only`. Strip the mode token before interpreting remaining arguments.

| Mode | When | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **Interactive** (default) | No mode token | Review, present findings, ask for decisions |
| **Autofix** | `mode:autofix` | No user interaction. Apply `safe_auto` fixes only, write artifact, emit residual work |
| **Report-only** | `mode:report-only` | Read-only. Report findings with no edits, no artifacts, no follow-up item creation |

### Autofix mode rules

- Skip all user questions
- Apply only `safe_auto` findings
- Leave `gated_auto`, `manual`, and `advisory` findings unresolved
- Write a review artifact to `docs/closure/`
- Create backlog follow-up items for unresolved actionable findings
- Never commit, push, or create a PR

### Report-only mode rules

- Skip all user questions
- Never edit files
- Return structured findings to caller
- Do not write a review artifact
- Do not create backlog follow-up items
- Safe for the ship agent to invoke during the build loop

## Severity Scale

| Level | Meaning | Build gate action |
|---|---|---|
| **P0** | Critical breakage, exploitable vulnerability, data corruption | Block commit |
| **P1** | High-impact defect in normal usage, breaking contract | Block commit |
| **P2** | Moderate issue (edge case, perf, maintainability) | Record as backlog follow-up item |
| **P3** | Low-impact, minor improvement | User's discretion |

## Action Routing

| Class | Default owner | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `safe_auto` | Review skill (autofix mode) | Deterministic local fix |
| `gated_auto` | agent-intercom approval | Fix exists but changes behavior/contracts |
| `manual` | Backlog follow-up item | Actionable work requiring human judgment |
| `advisory` | Informational | Learnings, rollout notes, residual risk |

Routing rules:

- Choose the more conservative route on disagreement between personas
- Only `safe_auto` findings enter the autofix queue
- `requires_verification: true` means a fix needs tests or re-review

## Reviewer Personas

### Always-On (every review)

| Persona Subagent | Focus |
|---|---|
| **Constitution Reviewer** | Constitutional compliance |
| **Rust Reviewer** | Language-specific safety and correctness |
| **Learnings Researcher** | Search compound library for related past issues |

### Conditional (based on changed files)

Use a different model from the caller when available to force genuine diversity of critique. Cross-model is preferred but not blocking.

| Persona Subagent | Select when diff touches | Suggested Model |
|---|---|---|
| **Architecture Strategist** | Module boundaries, new abstractions, dependency changes | Different from caller |
| **Concurrency Reviewer** | Concurrent/async patterns | Different from caller |
| **Scope Boundary Auditor** | Changes spanning multiple domains or exceeding expected scope | Different from caller |
| **Agent-Native Parity Reviewer** | MCP SDKs, tool handlers, agent-exposed actions, or user/agent parity-critical flows | Different from caller |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Determine Review Scope

1. Identify changed files from git diff, explicit file list, or caller-provided scope
2. Categorize each file by type and domain
3. Identify which instruction files apply (via `applyTo` patterns)
4. Broadcast the diff analysis

### Step 2: Route Personas

1. Always-on: spawn Constitution Reviewer, Rust Reviewer, Learnings Researcher
2. Conditional: analyze changed file paths, content patterns, and workspace agent-native signals to select additional personas
3. Broadcast the routing decision with persona count

### Step 3: Spawn Persona Subagents

Spawn all selected personas. Each receives:

- The list of changed files with line ranges
- The diff content relevant to their domain
- Instructions to return structured findings
- Codebase search directive (use grep/glob for context)

Broadcast each spawn.

### Step 4: Collect and Merge Findings

As each persona returns:

1. Broadcast the return with finding count
2. Collect all findings
3. Deduplicate: merge findings that identify the same issue
4. Assign final severity (more conservative on disagreement)
5. Assign final action routing

### Step 5: Apply Actions (mode-dependent)

**Interactive mode:**

1. Present findings grouped by severity (P0 first)
2. For each P0/P1, ask the user to accept, modify, or reject the recommendation
3. Apply approved fixes

**Autofix mode:**

1. Apply all `safe_auto` findings automatically
2. Create backlog follow-up items for unresolved actionable findings
3. Write review artifact to `docs/closure/`

**Report-only mode:**

1. Return structured findings to caller
2. No side effects: no edits, no review artifact, no follow-up items

When the diff changes runtime surfaces, include an explicit recommendation for whether follow-up runtime verification is required and which mode (`manual`, `api`, `browser`) is appropriate.

When the diff includes destructive potential, contract changes, migrations,
security-sensitive edits, or other high-blast-radius work, include an explicit
recommendation for whether strict-safety action classification or approval
follow-up is required before merge or deployment.

When the `adversarial-review` capability pack is installed and this review surfaces 3 or more
P0/P1 findings, recommend escalation to the `adversarial-review` agent for multi-model consensus
validation before blocking the build.

## Quality Criteria

* Every changed file is reviewed by at least the always-on personas
* All P0 findings are addressed before the review is marked complete
* P1 findings require explicit acknowledgment (fix or defer with rationale)
* The review report accurately reflects all findings and their resolution status


## Model Routing

This skill operates at **Tier 2 (Standard)** — review coordination and finding assembly.
