# Plan Review Gate

Validates implementation plans through multi-persona review before the harvest skill decomposes them into work items. This gate prevents flawed plans from generating flawed work hierarchies.

## Subagent Depth Constraint

This skill spawns reviewer subagents. Those subagents are leaf executors and MUST NOT spawn their own subagents. Maximum depth: plan-review skill → persona subagent (1 hop).

## Severity Scale

| Level | Meaning | Gate action |
|---|---|---|
| **P0** | Plan will produce unshippable or unsafe code (missing security, broken contracts, impossible scope) | Block harvest |
| **P1** | Plan has a high-impact gap that will cause significant rework (missing requirements, wrong decomposition, absent verification) | Block harvest |
| **P2** | Plan has a moderate gap (edge case coverage, missing test scenario, suboptimal decomposition) | Record as backlog follow-up |
| **P3** | Plan has a minor improvement opportunity (wording, optional optimization) | Advisory |

Use the same severity conventions as the code review skill adapted for plan
artifacts rather than code diffs.

## Agent-Intercom Communication

When the `agent-intercom` capability pack is installed, call `ping` at session start. If reachable, broadcast at every step. If unreachable, warn the operator that visibility is degraded.

| Event | Level | Message prefix |
|---|---|---|
| Review start | info | `[PLAN-REVIEW] Starting review of: {plan_path}` |
| Persona spawned | info | `[SPAWN] {persona_name} for plan review` |
| Persona returned | info | `[RETURN] {persona_name}: {finding_count} findings` |
| Merge complete | info | `[PLAN-REVIEW] Merged: {total_findings} findings ({p0} P0, {p1} P1, {p2} P2, {p3} P3)` |
| Gate decision | success/error | `[PLAN-REVIEW] Gate: {PASS\|FAIL\|ADVISORY}` |
| Review appended | success | `[PLAN-REVIEW] Review appended to: {plan_path}` |

## Inputs

* `plan_path`: (Required) Path to the plan file (`docs/exec-plans/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}-plan.md`).

If no path is provided, search `docs/exec-plans/` for the most recent `*-plan.md` file and confirm with the operator.

## Output

Review findings are **appended to the plan file** as a `## Plan Review` section,
not written as a separate file. The plan-review skill produces a gate decision
(`PASS`, `ADVISORY`, or `FAIL`) that is recorded in the appended section. When
the compact-context skill later consolidates the plan, it merges the plan and
appended reviews into a decided-plan.

## Reviewer Personas

Spawn all always-on personas and any triggered cross-model personas. Use different
models when available to force genuine diversity of critique.

### Always-On Personas (same model as caller)

| Persona Subagent | Focus |
|---|---|
| **Constitution Reviewer** | Map plan units against constitutional principles. Flag violations. |
| **Rust Reviewer** | Evaluate proposed type signatures, error handling patterns, package boundaries, and verification steps. |
| **Scope Boundary Auditor** | Verify units stay within declared scope. Detect scope creep, YAGNI, unnecessary complexity. |
| **Learnings Researcher** | Search `docs/compound/` for prior solutions relevant to the plan's scope. Report P0 if the plan contradicts a known past resolution; P1 if it ignores a highly relevant prior solution. |

### Cross-Model Personas (different model when available)

| Persona Subagent | Focus | Suggested Model |
|---|---|---|
| **Architecture Strategist** | Cohesion, coupling, module boundaries, dependency chains. | Different from caller |
| **Agent-Native Parity Reviewer** | Plans that expose MCP tools, agent-facing actions, or user/agent parity-sensitive workflows. | Different from caller |

If cross-model invocation is not available, run all personas with the caller's model. Multi-model is preferred but not blocking.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load and Parse Plan

1. Read the plan file from `docs/exec-plans/`.
2. Extract implementation units, dependency graph, decisions, risks, hardening signals, and whether a `## Plan Hardening` section is present.
3. When `strict-safety` is enabled and the plan contains a `## Plan Hardening` section, also extract any `ProposedAction` / `ActionRisk` entries.
4. If the plan references an origin document, read that too for context.
5. Broadcast: `[PLAN-REVIEW] Starting review of: {plan_path}`

### Step 2: Spawn Reviewer Subagents

Spawn all always-on personas plus the cross-model personas whose trigger
conditions are met. Each receives:

- The full plan content
- The origin requirements doc (if any)
- The project's coding standards and conventions (reference `.github/instructions/constitution.instructions.md`)
- Instructions to return structured findings

Broadcast each spawn.

### Step 3: Collect and Merge Findings

As each persona returns:

1. Broadcast the return with finding count
2. Collect all findings into a unified list
3. Deduplicate: merge findings that identify the same issue from different perspectives
4. Assign final severity (use the more conservative severity when personas disagree)

### Step 4: Gate Decision

| Condition | Decision | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Plan shows hardening signals but lacks plan hardening or equivalent high-risk detail | **FAIL** | Return the plan to `plan-harden` or manual revision before `harvest`. |
| Strict-safety enabled, hardening present, but risky actions lack `ProposedAction` / `ActionRisk` classification | **FAIL** | Plans with hardening signals must classify risky actions explicitly when strict-safety is active. |
| Any P0 or P1 findings | **FAIL** | Present findings to user. Plan must be revised before proceeding to `harvest`. |
| P2 findings only | **ADVISORY** | Present findings to user. User decides: revise or proceed. |
| P3 findings only or none | **PASS** | Log findings as advisory. Proceed to `harvest`. |

Broadcast the gate decision.

### Step 5: Append Review to Plan

Append a `## Plan Review` section to the plan file with:

* Gate decision and rationale
* Whether plan hardening was required and whether that requirement was satisfied
* All findings organized by severity
* Specific recommendations for addressing P0/P1 issues
* Acknowledgment of P2/P3 items for awareness
* Runtime verification and operational closure gaps called out explicitly when missing

The review is appended (not written as a separate file) so that the plan and its
review travel together as a single artifact. The compact-context skill later
consolidates this into a decided-plan.

## Quality Criteria

* Every implementation unit is reviewed by at least the always-on personas
* The gate decision correctly reflects finding severities
* Findings include actionable recommendations
* The review is appended to the plan before the gate decision is communicated
* Plans with hardening signals are failed when hardening is missing or materially incomplete
* Plans that touch runtime surfaces are checked for verification and closure readiness


## Model Routing

This skill operates at **Tier 2 (Standard)** — plan review coordination and finding assembly.
