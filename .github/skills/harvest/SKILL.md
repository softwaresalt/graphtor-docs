# Harvest Skill

The `harvest` skill turns a reviewed implementation plan into backlog
feature, task, and subtask items. It is the reusable decomposition step
invoked by the stage agent.

This skill does not perform planning or review. It assumes the incoming
plan has already been reviewed or otherwise approved for decomposition.

## Agent-Intercom Communication

When the `agent-intercom` capability pack is installed, call `ping` at
session start. If reachable, broadcast at every step. If unreachable,
warn the operator that visibility is degraded and continue locally.

| Event | Level | Message prefix |
|---|---|---|
| Session start | info | `[HARVEST] Starting: plan={input.plan}` |
| Plan accepted | info | `[HARVEST] Using reviewed plan: {plan_path}` |
| Structure parsed | info | `[HARVEST] Parsed implementation units: {unit_count}` |
| Dry run | info | `[HARVEST] Dry run: {feature_count} features, {task_count} tasks, {subtask_count} subtasks` |
| Feature created | info | `[HARVEST] Created feature: {feature_id} — {title}` |
| Task created | info | `[HARVEST] Created task: {task_id} — {title}` |
| Dependency wired | info | `[HARVEST] Dependency: {item_id} blocked by {depends_on}` |
| Complete | success | `[HARVEST] Complete: {feature_count} features, {task_count} tasks, {subtask_count} subtasks` |

## Inputs

* `${input:plan}`: (Required) Path to the reviewed implementation plan.
* `${input:dry_run:false}`: (Optional, defaults to `false`) Preview the
  planned hierarchy without creating entries.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Validate the reviewed plan

1. Read `${input:plan}` in full.
2. Confirm the file exists and represents an implementation plan.
3. Confirm the plan has already cleared the review gate or is explicitly
   marked ready for harvesting.
4. Broadcast the accepted plan path.
5. Halt if the plan is missing, unreadable, or clearly not ready for
   backlog creation. Recommend running `plan-review` first when the
   review state is unclear.

### Phase 2: Parse the plan structure

Extract the planning data needed for decomposition:

1. Root feature title from frontmatter and top-level headings.
2. Problem frame, requirements trace, decisions, and standards check
   for the root feature description.
3. Task candidates from each implementation unit.
4. Subtask candidates from file lists, acceptance criteria, verification
   steps, and test surfaces inside each implementation unit.
5. Dependency edges from the plan's dependency graph.

Use repository search tools to validate file references or symbols when
the plan mentions existing code locations that need confirmation.

### Phase 3: Build the hierarchy model

Map the plan into the backlog hierarchy:

* one feature representing the whole reviewed plan
* one task per implementation unit
* one or more subtasks per file group, verification slice, or explicit
  execution step inside the unit

Before creating anything, apply backlog shaping rules:

1. Keep tasks small enough to fit a focused implementation session
   (the 2-hour rule).
2. Keep each task within a single skill domain.
3. Require a verifiable exit state for every task and subtask.
4. Preserve plan references so downstream execution can trace work
   back to the plan.

**Parent-first ordering (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** Tasks require a `parent_id`
referencing an existing feature. The root feature MUST be created before any
tasks are created. If the harvest context does not include an existing parent
feature for task-kind work items, create or identify one before proceeding.
Omitting `parent_id` for task-kind artifacts violates the required
parent-child hierarchy (P-003 decomposition integrity) and may be blocked by
the configured backlog registry or policy gates.

When the `backlogit` capability pack is installed and the registry advertises
`features.shipments: true`, the parent feature MUST be added to the shipment
before its child tasks during shipment assembly. This ordering is enforced
downstream by the Ship agent — flag it explicitly in the harvest report so
Ship can assemble the shipment correctly.

### Phase 4: Execute or preview

If `${input:dry_run}` is `true`:

1. Produce the proposed feature, task, subtask, and dependency structure.
2. Broadcast the dry-run counts.
3. Do not call backlog mutation tools.

If `${input:dry_run}` is `false`:

1. Query the backlog first to avoid duplicate root features.
   Use `backlogit_list_items` or `backlogit_search_items` to check for existing
   items with matching titles.
2. Create the root feature via `backlogit_create_item` or
   `backlogit add --type {type} --title {title}`.
3. Create one task per implementation unit under that feature.
4. Create granular subtasks under each task.
5. Wire dependencies when the backlog tool supports dependency operations
   (check the backlog registry for availability).
6. Broadcast each created feature, task, and dependency edge as it is
   written.

### Phase 5: Verify and report

1. Confirm the created hierarchy through backlog read operations.
2. Report the created IDs, counts, and dependency summary.
3. Return the ready backlog as the output of the planning pipeline.
4. Recommend handing the resulting backlog to the build-and-ship
   workflow for harness, build, review, CI, and pull request execution.

## Guardrails

* Do not modify the plan file.
* Do not skip duplicate checks.
* Do not create shipment artifacts from this skill. Shipment assembly
  happens downstream in Stage (Step 5.5) or Ship (fallback path).
* Keep descriptions self-contained enough for the next executor to act
  without reopening the plan for basic context.

## Model Routing

This skill operates at **Tier 2 (Standard)** — backlog decomposition is structured and deterministic.
