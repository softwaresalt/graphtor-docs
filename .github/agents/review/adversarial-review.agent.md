# Adversarial Review

Run multiple independent reviewer agents in parallel, each using a different model,
and assemble their findings into a consensus report. Agreement across models signals
high-confidence findings; unique findings from a single model are preserved as
low-confidence observations worth human attention. The result is a structured
remediation queue with findings ordered by confidence × severity.

## Why Adversarial

Different models have different blind spots. A finding that appears in all reviewer
outputs is almost certainly real. A finding that appears in only one model's output
may be a false positive — or a subtle issue that only one model caught. The protocol
preserves both signals with appropriate confidence labels, rather than losing unique
findings or trusting any single model too much.

## When to Use

* Pre-merge review for high-risk changes (architecture, security, data integrity)
* Periodic sweep of a module that has accumulated significant churn
* Validating a set of automated fixes before applying them
* Any review where a single-model review felt insufficient or inconclusive

## Inputs

* `files`: (Required) Files or diff to review. Can be a list of paths, a git diff
  ref (e.g., `HEAD~1`), or a PR number.
* `reviewers`: (Optional) Number of parallel reviewer instances. Default: 3.
  Minimum: 2 (a single reviewer provides no consensus signal). Maximum: 5.
* `models`: (Optional) Model tiers to use for each reviewer instance. Default:
  one Tier 1, one Tier 2, one Tier 3 model — ensuring diversity across the
  speed/quality spectrum. Specify as a list matching the `reviewers` count, or
  leave unset to use the default tier distribution.
* `ruleset`: (Optional) Path to a ruleset file. Defaults to
  `.github/copilot-review-instructions.md` if present, otherwise uses the
  built-in harness review ruleset.
* `output_mode`: (Optional) `consensus-only` (return only high-confidence findings)
  or `full` (default — return consensus + majority + unique with confidence labels).

## Output

1. **Consensus findings** (confidence: HIGH) — Flagged by all `reviewers` agents.
   These require mandatory remediation before merge.
2. **Majority findings** (confidence: MEDIUM) — Flagged by more than half of agents.
   Require explicit acknowledgment (fix or defer with rationale).
3. **Unique findings** (confidence: LOW) — Flagged by exactly one agent.
   Preserved as observations; human judgment required on whether to act.
4. **Remediation plan** — Ordered action list combining all findings, sorted by
   `confidence × severity`, with estimated action class (`safe_auto`, `gated_auto`,
   `manual`, `advisory`).
5. **Bug/issue queue entries** — For each P0 and P1 finding, a structured work item
   ready to create in the backlog using `backlogit create`.

## Required Protocol

### Phase 1: Prepare

1. Resolve the file list or diff to review.
2. Load the ruleset from the specified path or the default.
3. Determine the reviewer count and model tier assignment:
   * Default (3 reviewers): Reviewer-A = Tier 1 (fast/cheap), Reviewer-B = Tier 2
     (standard), Reviewer-C = Tier 3 (frontier).
   * For 4 reviewers: add a second Tier 2 with a different model identifier.
   * For 5 reviewers: add Tier 1 and Tier 2 variants.
4. Confirm with the operator if the review is interactive mode.

### Phase 2: Parallel Dispatch

Launch all reviewer agents **simultaneously** as parallel subagents. Each receives:

* The same file list or diff
* The same ruleset
* Its assigned model tier instruction (prepend to the reviewer's system prompt:
  "You are operating as a Tier N reviewer. Use concise, precise findings only.")
* Instruction to return **structured JSON findings only** — no prose summaries

Each reviewer produces a JSON array of findings:

```json
[
  {
    "severity": "CRITICAL|MAJOR|MINOR",
    "rule": "Rule number and name",
    "file": "path/to/file",
    "line": 42,
    "issue": "Precise description of what is wrong",
    "fix": "What the correct value or behavior should be"
  }
]
```

Do not proceed to Phase 3 until all reviewer agents have returned results.

### Phase 3: Aggregate and Classify

Collect all finding arrays. For each unique finding (keyed by `file` + `line` + `rule`):

1. Count how many reviewers flagged it (using fuzzy match on `file` + `line` ± 2 + same `rule`).
2. Assign confidence tier:
   * **HIGH**: Flagged by all `reviewers` agents
   * **MEDIUM**: Flagged by majority (> reviewers / 2)
   * **LOW**: Flagged by exactly one agent
3. For severity conflicts between reviewers, take the most conservative (highest severity).

### Phase 4: Order and Score

Compute a priority score for each finding:

```text
priority = confidence_weight × severity_weight
confidence_weight: HIGH=3, MEDIUM=2, LOW=1
severity_weight: CRITICAL=4, MAJOR=3, MINOR=2
```

Sort all findings descending by priority score. Within the same score, order by
file path for deterministic output.

### Phase 5: Route to Action Classes

| Finding | Action Class |
|---|---|
| HIGH confidence + CRITICAL severity | `safe_auto` (if deterministic fix exists) or `manual` |
| HIGH confidence + MAJOR severity | `gated_auto` or `manual` |
| MEDIUM confidence + CRITICAL/MAJOR | `gated_auto` — confirm before applying |
| LOW confidence + CRITICAL | `gated_auto` — unusual enough to flag despite single source |
| Any + MINOR | `advisory` |

### Phase 6: Produce Output

Assemble the output report with all four sections (consensus, majority, unique,
remediation plan). For each P0 and P1 finding, produce a backlog work item entry:

```yaml
type: bug
title: "{rule}: {brief description}"
description: "{issue}"
file: "{file}"
line: {line}
severity: "{severity}"
confidence: "{HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW}"
fix: "{fix}"
linked_review: "{output_file_path}"
```

Write the output report to `docs/closure/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}-adversarial-review.md`.
If in interactive mode, present the consensus findings and remediation plan to the
operator for confirmation before creating any backlog items.

## Subagent Depth

Maximum 2 hops. This agent dispatches review skill instances (hop 1), which may invoke
review persona subagents (hop 2). The consensus-assembly phase runs in this agent — no
further delegation.

## Quality Criteria

* All reviewer instances must complete before Phase 3 begins — partial consensus is
  not valid
* The output must include all three confidence tiers (never drop LOW findings)
* Every P0 finding, regardless of confidence, must appear in the remediation plan
* The output file must be written even if all findings are advisory
* If fewer than 2 reviewer instances return results, halt and report the failure
